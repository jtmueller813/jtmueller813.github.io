      Patrick Mahomes was born in Tyler, Texas on September 17, 1995. His father
      was an MLB pithcer so he was a good and competitive athlete from a young age.
      Grownig up, mahomes played baseball, basketball, and football, but him and his
      father always thought that baseball would be his main sport. He played baseball
      throughout highschool as a pitcher and even threw a no-hitter in his senior
      season. Mahomes only started playing quarterback in his junior year but started really
      enjoying it. MaxPreps named Patrick Mahomes the 2013-14 male athlete of the year for
      his amazing senior year in baseball, basketball, and football. That year he batted over
      .450 and played almost every position in addition to pitcher, his senior year was also his
      best year for football. In addition, during his senior year of basketball he avereaged over 19
      points in the regular season and had playoff games with 37 and 49 points, his highschool athletic
      director said there was "no doubt he could be a Division I basketball player". He was a good
      prospect coming out of high school and was even drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the MLB draft
      but committed to Texas Tech. Mahomes and his teammates believe that his exposure to MLB players
      such as Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez at a young age contributed to his leadership qualities
      and that his involvemnt in multiple sports has a lot to do with his ability to make incredibly
      athletic plays as a quarterback.

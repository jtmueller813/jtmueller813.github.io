    <h1 class="body_heading">Summary</h1>
    <p class="top_paragraph" id="indent">
      The expectations for the Chiefs were high going into the 2019-2020 season.
      They had almost gone to the Super Bowl the year before and the defense had
      been completely redone. The Chiefs glided through the first two games but
      had some issues against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, but were able to
      hold on to the win. In week 4 the Chiefs went to Detroit and managed to
      pull out a win in a close game. In week 5 the Chiefs lost at home to the
      Colts 13-19. This game had many problems but the biggest was that Mahomes
      re-injured his ankle, after that the offense wasn’t able to do much. 13
      points is by far the least amount he has ever put up, his next lowest
      scoring games are two games with 23 points. The Chiefs also lost the next
      week to the Texans in a strange game. Week 7 is one of the most memorable
      of the season because Mahomes dislocated his knee and was a taken out of
      the game, luckily we were destroying the Broncos and Matt Moore was able
      to get the win. At this point almost all Chiefs fans were worried, our
      star quarterback sustained a serious injury and we had know idea how long
      he would be out. Next week against Green Bay, Matt Moore wasn’t able to
      out duel Aaron Rodgers but keeping it a close game was comforting for
      fans. In week 9 Matt Moore was able to beat the Vikings. Out of nowhere
      Patrick Mahomes was able to return after missing only two games and he had
      a massive game against the Titans with 446 yards and 3 touchdowns, but we
      lost at the last minute. We then beat the Chargers in Mexico and went into
      the bye week. Looking back on the season so far, there were mixed
      feelings. The defense had bright spots, especially lately, but did show
      that there were still weaknesses, the large amount of injuries before the
      bye had a big impact on the team. Mahomes had looked good but his health
      was an issue that needed to be addressed. Coming out of the bye, the
      Chiefs won 4 straight games, including one in New England, where the
      defense looked great and Mahomes stayed healthy. Going into the final week
      the Chiefs were looking at most likely getting a 3 or 4 seed in the
      playoffs, if we won our last game we would secure a 3 seed with the chance
      of a 2 seed if the Patriots somehow lost to the 4-11 Dolphins. Somehow
      Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins managed the upset which gave the Chiefs
      the number 2 seed with the extremely valuable first-round bye.

      In the divisional round the Chiefs were set to have a rematch against the
      Texans who came into arrowhead and won earlier in the year. The game
      didn't start off as Chiefs fans would have liked, the Texas were leading
      24-0 early in the 1st quarter and it was looking bad, we had fumbles,
      drops, and blown coverages. The Chiefs didn't quit, all of a sudden the
      Chiefs gained momentum off a Texans fumbled and failed fake punt. Patrick
      Mahomes threw 4 touchdowns in the blink of an eye to get the score to
      28-24 at halftime. In the second half the Chiefs kept rolling, only
      allowing the Texans to score more points, and win the game 51-31. The
      Chiefs who had been down 24-0 came out of nowhere to score 41 unanswered
      points, that is almost unheard of. The Chiefs got very lucky because the
      first seed Ravens lost to the red hot Titans who had managed not only to
      upset the 1st seed Ravens, but prior to that they went into New England
      and beat Tom Brady. The Chiefs were lucky enough to host the AFC
      Championship game for the second year in a row but would have to slow down
      the NFL rushing leader Derrick Henry who had been rolling teams in the
      playoffs getting 182 and 195 yards in the previous two games. The Chiefs
      got off to a slow start allowing the Titans to go up 10-0 in the first
      quarter but were able to bounce back and win 35-24. The most impressive
      part of the win was that the Chiefs were able to hold Henry to only 69
      yards.

      The Super Bowl looked like a very even match between the Chiefs and 49ers
      but the biggest threat from San Fransisco had to be their amazing
      defensive line that was likely to give Mahomes some problems. The teams
      were pretty even in the first half, the 49ers kept Mahomes in check and
      the Chiefs defense did the same; it was tied 10-10 at half. The 49ers came
      out of the half and played well on both sides of the ball, they scored 10
      points and were able to slow down the offense with two Mahomes
      interceptions in the 3rd quarter. Losing 20-10 with 9 minutes left in the
      4th quarter didn't look good but the Chiefs were able to get a touchdown
      drive followed by a three and out for the 49ers. The Chiefs also got a
      touchdown on the next drive followed by another defensive stop. To end the
      game the Chiefs got one more touchdown, winning Super Bowl LIV 31-20.
      Mahomes won Super Bowl MVP, some believe that Damien Williams should have
      won it, and secured his place as an all-time great. The Chiefs had a lot
      of things go their way in the playoffs to get them three but they went
      through so much adversery through the season that thier victory was such
      an outstanding accomplishment.

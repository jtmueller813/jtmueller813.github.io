    <h1 class="body_heading">Summary</h1>
    <p class="top_paragraph" id="indent">
      Going into the 2018 season, NFL fans didn't know what to expect from
      Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs traded Alex Smith in the offseason to give
      Mahomes the starting position. Mahomes looked decent in his one rookie
      start but no one expected Mahomes to put up the numbers that he did.
      Mahomes came out swinging in 2018, in Week 1 he threw 4 touchdowns and in
      Week 2 he threw 6 TD's. The Chiefs won the first five games but then had
      to go on the road to the Patriots, one of the hardest places to win a
      game. If anyone could do it, it was Mahomes. The Chiefs started off badly
      but came back in the second half to almost win. The Chiefs then won the
      next four games to go to 9-1. Mahomes continued to have a great and
      historic season and was part of one of the most entertaining NFL games of
      all time. In Week 11 the Chiefs travelled to LA where the two top offenses
      would face off. Mahomes threw six touchdowns in the 54-51 loss to the Rams
      in a crazy Monday night game. The Chiefs finished a great 2018 regular
      season with a record of 12-4 with the top seed in the AFC.

      The playoffs are scary times for Chiefs fans, the previous three years we
      never made it past the Divisional round. At this point fans were already
      in love Mahomes but we needed him to break our playoff "curse". The Chiefs
      beat the Colts 31-13 whithout much trouble but our real challenge would be
      in the AFC Championship game. This was the first time Arrowhead had hosted
      a Championship game and the fans were excited, but cautious because we
      would have to take out Tom Brady and the Patriots who have dominated the
      AFC for many years. The Patriots didn't really have a great year, they
      relied almost entirely on their run game and elite defense, but still
      ended up as the 2nd seed due to their easy schedule. The Chiefs were shut
      down in the first half but came out swinging in the second. The Chiefs
      offense could strike at any time and we were never out of a game. The
      offense made many short touchdown drives to take us into overtime. The
      Patriots won the cointoss started with the ball, the Chiefs defense had
      struggled all year and was our biggest weakness. The Patriots were driving
      when all of a sudden Tom Brady threw and incredibly rare late game
      interception, but the curse was not broken, the play was called back due
      to on offsides and the Patriots ran the ball down the field to win.
    </p>
    <p class="bottom_paragraph" id="indent">
      This was a dissapointing season because we were clearly the best team in
      the AFC, if not the whole NFL, and we could have had a rematch with the
      Rams in the Superbowl. Instead we had the lowest scoring Super Bowl ever
      where Tom Brady got his sixth ring. Although it didn't seem like Mahomes
      broke our curse we saw his leadership, resilience, and ability to carry
      our team, we knew that if would improve our defense we would be next to
      unstoppable.

    <h1 class="body_heading">Summary</h1>
    <p class="single_paragraph" id="indent">
      Chiefs fans were split on if they wanted Mahomes to start in his rookie
      year or learn behind Alex Smith. Smith was coming off a pretty good 2016
      season so the Chiefs decided to let the rookie sit and learn for the year.
      Smith was having the best season of his career but was benched in week 17
      to rest before the playoffs. Mahomes made his first career start at Denver
      and played decently, but most importantly he made some great plays and
      showed the ability to get better. For the second year in a row Alex Smith
      and the Chiefs would lose the Wildcard game at home. This left fans
      dissapointed because they loved Smith but knew it was time for change
      because they just weren't getting it done in the playoffs. The Chiefs
      decided to trade Smith to the Redskins in the offseason and Mahomes became
      the starter. Mahomes gives a lot of credit to Alex Smith for being his
      mentor and contributing to his success and it is not hard to believe
      because Smith knew the Chiefs offense very well and was a smart player.
